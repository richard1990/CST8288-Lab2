# CST8288 Lab 2 - Refactored Shannon's Theorem
This was my second lab assignment in my "Object-Oriented Programming with Design Patterns" course. This lab required refactoring <a href="https://github.com/richard1990/CST8288-Lab1b">Lab 1b (Shannon's Theorem)</a> to separate the presentation logic from the domain logic by creating a second class to encapsulate the attributes and calculations for Shannon's Theorem. The program also now asks the user if they want to run the program again, and if not the program will exit.

This lab also introduced me to JUnit. I created two test classes, ShannonsTheoremTest and ShannonsModelTest, that made use of JUnit 4 to test the two classes ShannonsTheorem and ShannonsModel.
